                <p>
                    My name is Sriharsha Kocherla, and my research interests lie 
                    in quantum algorithms and machine learning.<br><br>

                    I am currently working at the Computational Physics lab at Georgia Tech, 
                    where I focus on developing quantum algorithms for modeling fluid flows. 
                    I've been in this position since September 2021.<br><br>

                    Prior to this, I was involved in ML research and contributed to the 
                    development of a model that detects retinal junctions. <br><br>
                    
                    Overall, I'm passionate about developing new computational 
                    approaches and am excited to continue exploring these fields.

                    <div class = "description">Fluid flow simulations marshal our most powerful computational resources. In many cases, even
                        this is not enough. Quantum computers provide an opportunity to speedup traditional algorithms
                        for flow simulations. We show that lattice-based mesoscale numerical methods can be executed as
                        efficient quantum algorithms due to their statistical features. This approach revises a quantum
                        algorithm for lattice gas automata to eliminate classical computations and measurements at every
                        time step. For this, the algorithm approximates the qubit relative phases and subtracts them at the
                        end of each time step, removing a need for repeated measurements and state preparation (encoding).
                        Phases are evaluated using the iterative phase estimation algorithm and subtracted using single-qubit
                        rotation phase gates. This method delays the need for measurement to the end of the computation,
                        so the algorithm is better suited for modern quantum hardware. We also demonstrate how the
                        checker-board deficiency that the D1Q2 scheme presents can be resolved using the D1Q3 scheme.
                        The algorithm is validated by simulating two canonical PDEs: the diffusion and Burgersâ€™ equations
                        on different quantum simulators. We find good agreement between quantum simulations and classical
                        solutions of the presented algorithm.

                    <div class = "description">Computational modeling hinges on solving partial differential equations (PDEs) 
                        that require numerical solutions. These PDEs can comprise trillions of degrees of freedom and are thus 
                        expensive to solve classically. Recent developments in mesoscale numerical methods and quantum hardware 
                        present an opportunity to solve such PDEs efficiently. We analyze two such mesoscale methods: Lattice Gas 
                        Automata (LGA) and Lattice Boltzmann Methods (LBM). Quantum variants of these algorithms are implemented 
                        and analyzed. We show that existing approaches fail due to reliance on measurement and classical computation. 
                        The nature of this weakness is identified and algorithms that avoid it are formulated.

                    <div class = "description">Retinal junctions are important landmarks that are useful in the diagnosis of retinal diseases. 
                        But as the blood vessel structure is very complex, identification of these junctions requires an accurate, robust algorithm. 
                        We proposed a two-stage deep learning TensorFlow Object Detection (TFOD) framework to detect retinal junctions very accurately. 
                        In the first stage of the proposed framework, the network is trained to propose possible junctions, and in the next stage, they are 
                        refined entirely to reduce false predictions. Finally, the junctions are classified as crossovers and bifurcations. 
                        The experimentation was carried out on both the DRIVE and IOSTAR datasets. The results obtained are qualitatively presented.
