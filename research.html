                <p>
                    My name is Sriharsha Kocherla, and my research interests lie 
                    in quantum algorithms and machine learning.<br><br>

                    I am currently working at the Computational Physics lab at Georgia Tech, 
                    where I focus on developing quantum algorithms for modeling fluid flows. 
                    I've been in this position since September 2021.<br><br>

                    Prior to this, I was involved in ML research and contributed to the 
                    development of a model that detects retinal junctions. <br><br>
                    
                    Overall, I'm passionate about developing new computational 
                    approaches and am excited to continue exploring these fields.
